### Insights
---

1. Revenue by Product:

The Shoes product generated the highest revenue, with approximately 630K in sales.

Gloves and Socks also performed well, bringing in 290K and 270K, respectively.

Jacket and Hat generated the lowest revenue, indicating they may be lower in demand or less profitable.



2. Revenue by Region:

West is the top-performing region, generating 530K in sales, making up the largest share of revenue.

East follows with 48K, while North and South regions trail with 38K and 30K, respectively.

The West region dominates, potentially due to higher demand or better market penetration.



3. Sales Percentage by Region:

West represents the largest portion of sales at 56.66%, while East holds 24.66%.

South and North contribute to a lesser extent, with 10.83% and 8.35%, respectively.

This distribution indicates a heavy reliance on the West region for overall sales.



4. Quantity Sold by Product:

Shoes lead in quantity as well, with approximately 19.6K units sold.

Gloves and Socks also have high quantities sold, with around 12.4K and 10.4K units.

Products like Jacket and Hat have lower quantities, aligning with their lower revenue generation.



5. Current Year Sales (by Month):

February saw the highest sales, with 29K units.

Sales declined in March (15K) and April (5K) but picked up again by June (148K) and July (174K).

There is a significant fluctuation in monthly sales, which could reflect seasonality or marketing campaigns.



6. Quantity Sold by Region:

The East, North, South, and West regions all have similar quantities sold, each around 2,480 units.

This even distribution contrasts with the revenue distribution, suggesting that sales in the West region generate higher revenue per unit sold compared to other regions.



7. Revenue by Month and Year:

Sales peaked in June (247k), indicating a potential seasonal trend or successful marketing efforts.

Other months, like February and June, have significantly higher revenue.

These notable revenue spikes in February and June, may be worth investigating for future planning.




   ### Summary and Recommendations:
   ---

Product Strategy: Focus on products like Shoes, Gloves, and Socks as they generate both high revenue and quantity.
Consider promotional efforts to boost sales for low-performing products, such as Jackets and Hats.

Regional Strategy: Since the West region is a key driver of revenue, consider investing in targeted marketing campaigns 
in this area. Also, explore ways to increase profitability in the East, North, and South regions, where sales quantity 
is similar but revenue lags.

Sales Trends: The noticeable peaks in February and June may indicate seasonal demand. Analyze what drives these peaks to 
capitalize on similar trends in the future.

Revenue Optimization: Investigate why the West region achieves higher revenue per unit and explore replicating those factors 
in other regions.


This analysis can guide decision-making on product focus, regional marketing, and timing for campaigns to optimize sales and revenue.
